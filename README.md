# py-muscat

Review-stage Python reconstruction of a **subset** of muscat, following the discovery, preregistration and reference-validation workflow in [omicverse-rebuildr](https://github.com/omicverse/omicverse-rebuildr).

Sum pseudobulks and explicit-design/contrast pbDS with edgeR or limma-voom. No mixed models, limma-trend, treat, DESeq2, simulation framework or automatic design inference.

## Install and test

This project has not been published on PyPI. From this checkout:

```bash
python -m pip install ".[test]"
python -m pytest -q
```

## Usage and function map

See [the executed tutorial](examples/tutorial_fixture.ipynb), [R-to-Python parameter dictionary](examples/function_by_function_R_parity.ipynb), and [complete upstream export audit](AUDIT.md).
Inputs, orientations and unsupported modes are documented in function docstrings. No R process is used at runtime.

## Reproduce the R oracle

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HelenaLC/muscat.git ../muscat-ref
git -C ../muscat-ref checkout 861683175a1804430ced420397e72fff16fe92ed
Rscript tests/reference.R ../muscat-ref
python -m pytest -q
```

The runner sources the pinned upstream functions, not a rewritten R approximation. RUVSeq S4 registration is intercepted to execute only matrix methods. SPARK sparse sum/mean helpers are supplied by Matrix, with unchanged statistical functions. MuSiC and muscat functions are sourced with their R dependencies loaded. muscat's source declares R >=4.6; this selected function subset was executed on R 4.5.2, not installed as the full package.

muscat's public fixture additionally uses `Rscript tests/public_reference.R ../muscat-ref`.
All other primary fixtures are synthetic and do not establish biological accuracy. Numerical gates were committed before implementation and have not been widened.

## Validation and limitations

6 focused tests passed locally without skips. See [reconstruction report](RECONSTRUCTION_REPORT.md) for scope and remaining release checks. This is fixture-level equivalence, not full-domain or full-package equivalence. Runtime objects and failure messages are Python-native.

## Distribution preparation

The intended PyPI distribution is `py-muscat-omicverse`; the import remains `pymuscat`. See [release preparation](RELEASE.md) for installed-wheel validation and the manual Trusted Publishing procedure. This preparation does not mean a PyPI release is available.
